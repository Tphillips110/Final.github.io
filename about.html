                        <h3>Intro</h3>
                       <p> Hello, if you're reading this, it means I'm already dead and my work has become famous. However, if that isn't the case and I'm very much alive, then you've discovered a gold mine of great design! My name's Tyler Phillips, and while graphic design is my main focus, I also love to branch out and learn new things. This can include anything from learning how to animate, illustrating in a different style I'm unfamiliar with, to even attempting to program, I genuinely enjoy challenging myself and adding to my solid groundwork of graphic design to increase my ability as a designer.</p>
                       <h3>Interests</h3>
                       <p> Some of my interests include Tennis, Hockey, Video Games, Dungeons and Dragons, and obviously graphic design, website design, logo design, and typography. </p>
                       <h3>Inspirations</h3>
                       <p>I really enjoy adapting the things that I'm already interested in, into the world of graphic design. I've done things like designing tennis packaging, making infographics about dungeons and dragons, and esports style logo design.</p>
